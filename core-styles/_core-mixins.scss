    NewSpring Web Core Mixins -- Read First


    $WARNING

    The NewSpring Core Mixins, being an OO framework, work in
    keeping with the open/closed principle. The variables
    you set previously are now being used throughout the core
    to set defualt values for everything we use as a utility.
    Any custom styles or mixins SHOULD NOT be added or modified
    in the core directly, but added via your theme stylesheet
    as per the open/closed principle:

    Try not to edit any CSS beyond this point;
